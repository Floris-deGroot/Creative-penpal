# Creative-penpal

## The code used for the creative pen pal robot during IOB4-T2 mechatronics

### This code and the prototype were made by *Tobias Hilberink, Gerben Post en Floris de Groot.*

- Pin outs and connections can be found in the code or the **wire schema.png** file

- We do not take any responsibilty for failures of the machine or injuries during operation. 

- If something brakes, contact **f.j.t.degroot@student.tudelft.nl** I still have spare parts and can print new ones. 

- The **turn_pen.ino code** can be used to turn the pen holder back to an upright position in case it is out of allign ment. Use the **art** and the **signature (mondrio)** button to do this
